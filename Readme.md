### Introduction

In summary, Php is a very popular language used to create dynamic websites with access to information stored in a database. It is easy to learn and allows you to develop robust web applications quickly.

### Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial goal of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for now it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

*As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
