     /* In Php, the `try-catch` structure is used for exception handling. The exceptions are
     errors that occur during code execution and can be "thrown" (with the keyword
     `throw`) when something unexpected happens.

     The `try` block allows you to test a block of code for errors, and the `catch` block allows
     handle any exceptions that may be thrown in the `try` block. */

     //? Here is an example of how to use it:

     try {
         // Try to execute this block of code
         $result = 10 / 0; // This will throw a division by zero exception
     } catch (Exception $e) {
         //If an exception occurs, this block catches and handles the exception
         echo "An exception has occurred: " . $e->getMessage();
     }

     /* In this example, the code attempts to perform a divide by zero operation on the `try` block,
     which will generate an exception. The `catch` block will catch any exception of type `Exception`
     (can be a specific type of exception instead of `Exception`) and will handle the exception
     printing a message.

     It is good practice to capture specific types of exceptions to handle them more accurately and
     instead of catching all generic exceptions. This helps to understand and manage the
     possible errors more effectively in the code. */
