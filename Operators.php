     //* Operators - Php

     /* In Php, operators are symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on
     variables and values. There are several types of operators that perform different actions, from
     mathematical operations to comparisons and assignments. */

     //? Arithmetic Operators:

     // Perform basic mathematical operations.

     /*
     - **Sum (+)**: `$a + $b`
     - **Subtraction (-)**: `$a - $b`
     - **Multiplication (*)**: `$a * $b`
     - **Division (/)**: `$a / $b`
     - **Module (%)**: `$a % $b` (returns the remainder of the division)
     */

     //? Assignment Operators:

     // Used to assign values to variables.

     /*
     - **Assignment (=)**: `$a = 10`
     - **Assignment with operation (+=, -=, *=, /=)**: `$a += 5` (equivalent to `$a = $a + 5`)
     */

     //? Comparison Operators:

     // Compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).

     /*
     - **Equal (==)**: `$a == $b`
     - **Not equal (!= or <>)**: `$a != $b`
     - **Identical (===)**: `$a === $b` (compares value and type)
     - **Less than (<)**, **Greater than (>)**, **Less than or equal to (<=)**, **Greater than or equal to (>=)**
     */

     //? Logical operators:

     // Combines conditional expressions and returns a boolean result.

     /*
     - **And (&&)**: `$a && $b`
     - **Or (||)**: `$a || $b`
     - **Not (!)**: `!$a`
     */

     //? Concatenation Operator:

     // Combine text strings.

     /*
     - **Concatenation (.)**: `$greeting = "Hello " . $name;`
     */

     //? Increment/Decrement Operators:

     // Modify the value of a variable.

     /*
     - **Increment (++$a or $a++)**
     - **Decrement (--$a or $a--)**
     */

     //? Other Operators:

     /*
     - **Ternary Operator (expression ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse)**: `$result = ($age >= 18) ? "Elderly
     of age" : "Minor";`
     - **Member Access Operator (->)**: Allows access to members of an object.
     */

     /* These operators are essential in Php and are used to perform a wide range of operations,
     from mathematical calculations to comparisons and data manipulation. */
